      <blockquote class="left">
        <p>This class was helpful to me because it was teaching me about real world situations. Street law is my favorite class. This course let me strive to empower myself as a young adult. I was engaged and participated in the activities. That allowed me to create change in the school and in the community. The law- related education I received in this class was beneficial to me because I have more knowledge within the judicial system.</p>

        <p>Having this class really opened my eyes. Now that i am 18 I’m going to vote every time an election happens. Knowing more resources than just the news and social media is very important. It helps you see the real world and understand it more. </p>
